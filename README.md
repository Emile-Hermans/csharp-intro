# Introduction

This repo contains a quick introduction to C#.
Proceed as follows:

* Clone this repository. You'll need it to make the exercises.Cancel changes
* Let yourself be guided by the [companion text](https://ucll-vgo.github.io/csharp-intro/). *Make sure to follow it!* It contains valuable information to solve the exercises. 

## User's Guide

* To start working on an exercise, open the `.sln` file in the exercise's directory.
* To run the tests, open the Test Explorer (under the Test > Windows menu).

## Note About Solutions and Projects

To prevent confusion when Visual Studio asks you to save the 'solution', a quick
terminology primer:

* A Visual Studio *project* can be seen as a component of your application.
  For example, the actual code would be one project, the tests would be another.
* A Visual Studio *solution* is the "container" in which all projects are grouped.
  In other words, the solution represents the entirety of all projects that make up the application.

The exercises in this repository each consist of a single project, which
is why I didn't bother with creating a solution. However, Visual Studio
will still try to create one and might ask to create a solution file.
Whether you accept or reject the offer is up to you: it really
doesn't make much of a difference.
